We tested our rooms by randomly choosing the closet, the gazibo, the billiards, the dungeon, and the walkway.
We made constants equal to 26 to measure our board.
We chose the dungeon's right door, the kitchen's down door, the billiards' left door, the gazibo's corner door,
the family's up door, and a random office space to ensure that all the doors have their directions.
We tested the amount of doors we have.
Then we tested 8 of the rooms in different spots to ensure they all had the correct initials.
